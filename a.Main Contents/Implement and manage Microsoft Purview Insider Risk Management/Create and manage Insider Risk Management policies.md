## What are quick policies?

==Quick policies are preconfigured templates designed for common insider risk scenarios.== They use analytics and best practices to streamline the policy creation process, making them ideal for organizations that want to get started quickly without heavy customization.

### Examples of quick policies

- **Data leaks**: Focuses on accidental or intentional data sharing.
- **Data theft by departing users**: Detects potentially risky activities performed by users near their resignation or termination dates
- **Critical asset protection**: Detects risks involving valuable assets.
- **Email exfiltration**: Detects when sensitive files are emailed externally.

## What are custom policies?

Custom policies allow you to fully tailor the policy settings to fit your organization's unique requirements. They provide granular control over:

- **Scope**: Define specific users, groups, or adaptive scopes.
- **Content prioritization**: Focus on specific SharePoint sites, sensitivity labels, or file types.
- **Indicators and triggers**: Choose detailed conditions and thresholds.

### When to use custom policies

- When you need precise control over the policy's scope and configuration
- When your organization has complex or specific insider risk scenarios
- When aligning closely with internal compliance or security policies is required

# Create a custom Insider Risk Management policy

Insider Risk Management policies ==help organizations detect and respond to potential risks posed by insider activities. These policies are tailored to specific risk scenarios, such as data theft, data leaks, or security violations.==

## Overview of Insider Risk Management policies

==Insider Risk Management policies define the scope of users and the types of activities that generate alerts. Policies include conditions, thresholds, and risk indicators that identify potentially risky behavior.==

Key features of these policies:

- **Policy templates**: Predefined configurations tailored to specific risk scenarios.
- **Customizable indicators**: Detect various activities, such as data exfiltration or policy violations.
- **Risk scoring**: Assign risk scores based on activity and priority content.
- **Privacy by design**: Includes pseudonymization and role-based access controls.

Policies can be applied to the entire organization or scoped to specific users, groups, or content types.


# Manage policies in Insider Risk Management

==Creating effective Insider Risk Management policies is just the first step. As insider risks evolve, so must your policies. Regular management ensures that policies stay relevant, effective, and aligned with your organization's goals.== Proper management also helps you identify gaps, adjust thresholds, and refine settings to mitigate risks without creating unnecessary noise.


## Review policy health

Use the ==**Policy dashboard** in Microsoft Purview to view the health and effectiveness of your insider risk policies.== The dashboard provides an at-a-glance view of critical metrics and insights:

- **Policy name**: Lists all active policies.
- **Policy status**: Indicates whether the policy is healthy or has configuration warnings or recommendations. For example:
    
    - _Healthy_: No issues are detected.
    - _Recommendations_: Configuration improvements are suggested to enhance the policyâ€™s effectiveness.
    - _Warnings_: Policy functionality might be impaired due to incomplete configurations or other issues.
        
- **Active alerts**: Displays the number of alerts currently generated by the policy.
- **Confirmed alerts**: Tracks the number of alerts validated as true positives over the last 365 days. 
- **Actions taken on alerts**: Summarizes alerts that were confirmed or dismissed over the past year.
- **Policy alert effectiveness**: Shows the percentage of confirmed alerts divided by the total actions taken on alerts, providing a measure of the policy's success.
