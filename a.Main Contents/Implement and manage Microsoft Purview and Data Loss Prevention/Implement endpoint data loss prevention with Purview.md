==Endpoint data loss prevention (Endpoint DLP) is a feature of Microsoft Purview that extends DLP capabilities to endpoint devices like desktops and laptops.== It allows organizations to track and control how sensitive data is accessed, shared, or moved directly on user devices, including actions like copying data to external USB drives, printing sensitive files, or uploading data to websites.

## Workflow for implementing endpoint DLP

==Implementing endpoint DLP involves multiple steps, from onboarding devices to configuring policies and monitoring activities.== A structured workflow helps avoid gaps in coverage, minimizes disruptions, and ensures smooth policy enforcement. Following these steps to help you design and deploy endpoint DLP efficiently.

### Onboard devices
Before you can monitor or protect sensitive data, devices need to be onboarded into Microsoft Purview. This includes ensuring that devices running Windows 10/11 or macOS are running supported versions and are connected to the Endpoint DLP service.

### Configure endpoint DLP settings
Before setting up policies, you need to configure settings that dictate how endpoint DLP operates across the organization. Settings include:

- **Browser restrictions**: Define which browsers can handle sensitive data. Block unapproved browsers from transferring protected files.
- **Removable media and bluetooth controls**: Restrict access to USB drives and Bluetooth apps, ensuring sensitive files canâ€™t be copied or shared via these channels.
- **Just-in-time (JIT) protection**: This feature temporarily blocks file-sharing activities until sensitive data is evaluated, ensuring protection before the data leaves the endpoint.

### Define endpoint DLP policies

==Next, create DLP policies that control how sensitive data is monitored and protected. ==These policies define what is considered sensitive and how the system should respond to potential violations.

- **Conditions**: Set rules for identifying sensitive data. Conditions can include detecting specific types of information such as financial data, personal information, or intellectual property.
- **Monitoring activities**: Specify activities to be monitored on devices, such as file uploads, USB transfers, or clipboard copying. Monitoring ensures you track sensitive data interactions across various endpoints.
- **Actions**: Define what actions the system should take when a violation occurs. You can choose to block the activity, warn the user, or log the event for auditing purposes.

### Simulate policies

==Before enforcing policies across the organization, simulate them to test their effectiveness.== Simulation mode lets you see how policies behave without effecting users, making it easier to spot false positives or missing protections.

- **Fine-tuning**: Use the results of the simulation to adjust conditions and actions before final enforcement. This step is crucial to avoid unnecessary disruptions or misconfigurations.

### Deploy and enforce policies

==Once the simulation results meet your expectations, you can start deploying endpoint DLP policies across the organization.== It's important to roll these policies out in stages to ensure minimal disruption.

- **Start with a pilot group**: Begin with a small, representative group of users from different departments or roles. This pilot helps you verify policy behavior in real-world settings and catch any issues, such as false positives, without impacting the entire organization.
- **Collect and analyze feedback**: As the pilot runs, monitor how well the DLP policies perform. Use user feedback and violation data to fine-tune the policies, reducing false positives and ensuring smooth operations before expanding the scope.
- **Gradual rollout**: After validating the policies in the pilot group and making necessary changes, gradually expand the rollout to more users. This phased approach reduces the risk of widespread disruptions while ensuring comprehensive protection.
- **Full enforcement**: Once you're confident in the policies, enforce them across the entire organization. Continue to use activity tracking and alerts to monitor for violations and adjust the policy as needed to maintain effectiveness.

### Monitor activities and respond to alerts

==Once endpoint DLP is live, continuously monitor for violations and take the necessary remediation steps.== Use tools like the **DLP Alerts dashboard** and **Activity explorer** to get visibility into any policy violations.

- **DLP alerts**: ==Review incidents triggered by DLP policies and assess their severity.==
- **Remediation**: Take actions such as ==blocking user access, quarantining sensitive files, or providing training to users involved in violations.==



# Configure settings for endpoint DLP

Configuring endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) settings helps organizations monitor, restrict, and protect sensitive data when users share, copy, or upload files.

# Deploy the Microsoft Purview browser extension

==Microsoft Purview provides browser extensions for **Google Chrome** and **Mozilla Firefox** to extend endpoint data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities on Windows devices.== These extensions allow organizations to monitor and enforce DLP policies on sensitive data being accessed or shared through the browser, helping prevent unauthorized data leakage.


### Organization-wide deployments

==For large-scale deployments, your organization can use Microsoft Intune or Group Policy ==to automate installation across multiple devices. See the resources in the table for details:


# Configure just-in-time (JIT) protection

==Just-in-time (JIT) protection temporarily halts data egress activities like uploads, file transfers, and clipboard copying until the system classifies the data against your data loss prevention (DLP) policies. ==This ensures that no sensitive information is shared before necessary protections are enforced, minimizing the risk of accidental or malicious data exposure. JIT can also audit activities for excluded users and provides fallback options to allow or block actions if classification doesn't complete.

## How JIT protection works

==JIT fills the gap between a user's action and the system's ability to enforce DLP policies. It ensures sensitive data stays protected before the classification process is complete. ==Administrators can block actions for in-scope users and audit actions for users outside the scope, depending on organizational needs. JIT protection is available on **Windows 10** and **Windows 11** devices and offers flexibility through configurable fallbacks and exclusions, helping to minimize workflow disruptions while maximizing data security.
